# React-Native-Ecommerce

This project is a simplified implementation of a shopping system, the project aims to provide the basic features that are expected to be found in a mobile e-commerce application where users can purchase and sell products. To navigate through the app, users have to authenticate themselves. Once logged-in, users can scroll through the list of available products, add different products to the cart, and make orders.
